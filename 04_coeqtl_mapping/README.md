# 04_coeqtl_mapping

*plot_effect_concordance_across_cohorts.R*:  compares effect sizes (Z-scores) calculated in each individual dataset (before the meta-analysis)

*plot_celltype_overlap_upset.R* : upset plot overlap of significant co-eQTLs between cell types

*power_analyis_coeqtls.R* : explores how the number of tests reduce the power to detect co-eQTLs, taking estimates for number of tests based on how many genes are expressed above different cutoffs for Oelen v3 dataset
